# celeste-mechanics
Making some mechanics from the hit platformer game celeste in the hit minecraft server legitimoose.com

## Custom command-related features used
Without these addons, this would only partially work, if at all

**Modifying certain player data**
- Motion
- abilities
- possibly some others

**/inventory**
"Forcing" players to open an inventory, just like how plugins already can, just inside a datapack

**/playerlist**
Modifying the player list to show custom things below the normal player list (can be done with plugins too!)
